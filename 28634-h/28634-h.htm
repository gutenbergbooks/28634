<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The settlement of Englishmen at Jamestown in 1607 was the
outgrowth of a vision of transatlantic expansion which had been
growing stronger steadily during the preceding generation. It
was in the following of that vision that Queen Elizabeth granted
to a group of men headed by Sir Walter Raleigh the authority
to establish a colony upon the remote shores of the Atlantic ocean,
and out of the plans of this group came the ill-fated colony which
was started at Roanoke Island, in what is now the State of North
Carolina, in the year 1585. This colony after a life of a few years
disappeared: whether destroyed by Indian attack, or by a Spanish
fleet which resented the settlement of Englishmen in a land that
was claimed for Spain, or by famine or disease, no one knows to
this day. The one permanent result was the giving of the name
Virginia to their American land in honor of their Queen.</p>

<p>Following the failure of this first effort, a plan was formulated
and established by charter given by King James in the year 1606.
Under this charter companies were to be formed in order to found
two English settlements in America; one to be a colony at some
point between the 34th and 41st degrees of latitude, and the
other between the 38th and 45th degrees. Both companies had
the widespread interest of the English people, and both made
settlements in America in the same year, 1607. The Virginia
Company established its settlement at Jamestown, from which
developed the Colony, and later the Commonwealth of Virginia,
as the first permanent English settlement in America. The Plymouth
Company made its settlement upon the coast of what is
now Maine; but this effort failed and the colonists returned home
in the following year. Permanent settlement of New England
began in 1620 with the coming of the Pilgrims to Plymouth,
Massachusetts. From these two first settlements thus widely separated,
but with their common ideal of English civilization and
English concepts of freedom and self-government, has grown
the American nation of today. This nation, while welcoming all
the gifts and values which people of other nations have brought
to the enrichment and broadening of our common life, is still
basically an English or Anglo-Saxon nation.</p>

<p>Many impelling motives animated the men who organized
the Virginia company and labored for the establishment of a
colony in America. They wanted of course the expansion of
British trade and a wider market for British manufactures; and
they naturally hoped for financial profit from their investment
in shares of stock in the companies. They planned, also, not merely
trading posts in a foreign land as in India and elsewhere, but
an extension and expansion of the empire of Great Britain.</p>

<p>A most important part of their plan was to make colonies the
answer to a problem which was pressing for solution: the problem
of what to do with the increasing overplus of population in
many of the cities of England. The danger of a population too
great for the land of England to support and feed was a real one.
A colony to which England could send her overplus population
as part of a greater England was a real solution, and a better one
than would be the raising of grain and foodstuff by foreign countries
to feed the hungry of Great Britain. That men were thinking
along this line appears from the action of certain large towns
in paying the expense of the voyage of young people by the
score or hundred to Virginia, and from the plan soon after the
first settlement, whereby young women of reputable families
were sent to Virginia to become wives of the colonists.</p>

<p>And still another motive was the religious one. The Virginia
Company kept constantly in the forefront their plan to Christianize
the Indians. Their plan as they began to put it into effect
included the establishment of parishes and the selection of
fit clergymen to go overseas; to establish a University with a
college therein for Indians, and to take Indian youths into English
families to fit and prepare them for their college. They secured
from both King and Archbishop the authority and permission
to bring the expatriated Pilgrim Fathers back under the
English flag, and give them a settlement in Virginia, a plan which
failed after the Pilgrims had started for their promised new home.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_ONE" id="CHAPTER_ONE"></a>CHAPTER ONE<br /><br />

Beginnings</h2>


<p>The men who came to Jamestown brought the ideals and ways
of life of the mother country; its common law, the enactments
of Parliament, the Church of their people; and as shown in the
prayer written in England which the commanding officer of the
colony was required to use daily at the setting of the watch, they
hoped also that the natives of the land might be brought into
the Kingdom of God. They made petition for their own needs,
but they prayed also:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And seeing, Lord, the highest end of our plantation here is to set
up the standard and display the banner of Jesus Christ, even here
where Satan's throne is, Lord let our labour be blessed in labouring
the conversion of the heathen; and because thou usest not to work
such mighty works by unholy means, Lord sanctifie our spirits and
give us holy hearts that so we may be thy instruments in this most
glorious work.</p></div>

<p>It is of real significance that the London Company made its
first settlement a parish after the manner of the Church of England,
and elected as its first rector the Reverend Richard Hakluyt,
one of the most noted clergymen in England, and a man who
had captured the imagination of all with his books on travel in
far lands. He was expected to remain in England and represent
the needs of the colonists and help, perhaps, to select clergymen
to go to new parishes which would be formed as settlements developed.
The religious aspect of the movement was approved by
the Archbishop of Canterbury, and he approved also the selection
of the Reverend Robert Hunt who came to Jamestown as the
vicar of the parish and the pastor of the colonists.</p>

<p>The London Company made a provision that each new settlement
should become a parish with its own rector. The first settlements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
were established by the Company itself and were called
"Cities" after the ideal and pattern of Geneva. That city, the
home of John Calvin and of the Calvinistic theology which so
strongly influenced the Church of England in the Seventeenth
Century, was a self-governing unit in the Swiss Confederation.
It consisted of the city and its suburban territory and was the
prototype from which the "City" or "Hundred" in Virginia and
the "Township" or "town" in Massachusetts were formed.</p>

<p>There were four Cities in Virginia: James City, Charles City,
The City of Henrico, and Elizabeth City. They were boroughs
at the time of the first meeting of the General Assembly of Virginia
in 1619, each one electing its own Burgesses. And as counties
now, instead of cities, each one elects its own Delegates to
the Assembly. There were four "cities," three "hundreds," and
four "plantations" represented by Burgesses in the first Assembly
in 1619, and each one was a separate parish. Official records have
long been lost but the names are known of some six clergymen
who were incumbents of parishes in Virginia between 1607 and
1619.</p>

<p>The London Company had a rule that every clergyman who
volunteered or was invited to go to a parish in Virginia was to
be investigated as to character and fitness, and each one of them
was taken by a committee to a church to read the service and
preach a sermon as part of the investigation.</p>

<p>It is not generally known, perhaps, but plans for the immediate
development of the life of the colonists included the establishment
of a university which would set aside one hall or college
for the education of Indian youth and another for the education
of sons of English families. The London Company in 1618 made
a grant of ten thousand acres of land on the north side of the
James River and immediately to the east of the present-day City
of Richmond. That grant was to be the seat of the University and
was to be developed as a group of tenant farms with the college
buildings in the center. So great was the interest throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
England in the plan that the King as the temporal head of the
Church presented the matter to the whole people of England.
In 1617 he wrote the Archbishops of Canterbury and York:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Most Reverend Father in God: Right trustie and well beloved
Counsellor, we greet you well: You have heard ere this of the attempt
of divers worthy men, our subjects, to plant in Virginia, under the
warrant of our letters of patent, people of this Kingdom, as well as for
the enlarging of our dominions as for the propogation of the Gospel
amongst infidells; wherein there is good progress made, and hope
of further increase: so as the undertakers of that plantation are now
in hand with the erection of some churches and schools for the education
of the children of these barbarians, which cannot but be to
them a very great charge, and above the expense which for the civil
plantation doth come to them, in which we doubt not but that you
and all others who wish well to the increase of Christian religion
will be willing to give all assistance and furtherance you may, and
therein to make experience of the zeal and devotion of our well
minded subjects; especially those of the clergy.</p>

<p>Wherefore we do require you, and hereby authorize you to write
your letters to the several bishops of the dioceses in your province,
that they do give order to the ministers and other zealous men of
their dioceses, both by their own example in contribution and by
exhortation to others, to move our people within their several charges
to contribute to so good a work in as liberal a manner as they may.</p></div>

<p>Under instructions from the King offerings were to be taken
in every parish four times a year for two years, the money collected
to be sent to the bishops and by them forwarded to the
treasurer of the London Company. The treasurer reported later
that more than fifteen hundred pounds sterling had been sent
to him, and later he reported additional amounts. In that period
three bequests aggregating more than a thousand pounds sterling
were reported for the Christianizing of the Indians. Other gifts
included a "communion cup with cover and a plate of silver guilt
for the bread" with communion silk and linen cloths and other
ornaments, all to be placed within a church for Indians to be
built under another bequest. This communion chalice and paten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
are owned today by one of the oldest parishes in Virginia, and
are in St. John's Church, of Elizabeth City Parish, at Hampton.</p>

<p>On one of the ships sailing from England to the East Indies
an appeal was made by the chaplain in behalf of the university
in Virginia and gifts were made in such large amount that when
they were sent to Virginia they sufficed for the erection of "a
publique free schoole" to be connected with the university. They
named it "The East India School." The General Assembly, when
it first met in July 1619, adopted a resolution urging English
families to take promising Indian youths into their homes to
teach them the fundamentals and prepare them for the opening
of the college.</p>

<p>The work of establishing the university was already proceeding;
land was being cleared; farm houses were being erected;
more than one hundred artisans and workmen had been sent
from England and the college buildings were under construction
when on Good Friday, March 22, 1621/22, the great Indian
massacre occurred. A full third of all the English people in Virginia
were killed by Indians in one fatal day. The buildings at
the university were burned to the ground, and every English
man, woman and child in every family of the artisans and workmen
was killed. The East India School was burned to the ground.
Indeed the only thing that saved the colony from utter extermination
was that Chanco, an Indian who had become a Christian,
had learned of the plot the night before the massacre and warned
the Englishman, Richard Pace, with whom he lived. Pace crossed
the James River and warned the residents of Jamestown. So it
was that Jamestown and some of the adjoining settlements were
warned in time to protect themselves.</p>

<p>The massacre was of course a terrific catastrophe to the whole
colony. Outlying settlements had to be abandoned and the colony
was engaged in war with the Indians for several years. Then a
second catastrophe occurred. King James became dissatisfied with
the independent attitude of the London Company and personally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
secured its dissolution in 1624. He then took control of Virginia
as a Royal Colony and he himself appointed the Governor and
Council of the colony.</p>

<p>This ended all plans for the opening of the university. The
King died in the following year and his son, King Charles I, was
not interested in a university in Virginia. Nor was he or anyone
else interested in sending ministers to the colonial parishes.</p>

<p>The London Company, with a membership including representatives
of the Church and the universities, and of business
interests and the higher social classes, had the confidence of the
people. The King did not. He had their loyalty as their sovereign,
but the spiritual and cultural welfare of a colony overseas carried
little weight amid the political cross-currents and the self-seeking
of a royal court.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TWO" id="CHAPTER_TWO"></a>CHAPTER TWO<br /><br />

The Colonists at Worship</h2>


<p>There are several first-hand accounts of religious worship in
the earliest days of the Jamestown colony. Captain John Smith
wrote of the men at worship in the open air until a chapel could
be erected. He describes the scene of a celebration of the Holy
Communion, with the Holy Table standing under an old sail
lashed from tree to tree, with a bar of wood fastened between
two trees as the pulpit, and men kneeling on the ground before
their first altar. Services were held daily, according to the rules
of the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> which they brought with them:
morning prayer and evening prayer everyday, and sermons twice
on Sunday and once during the week. The law of the Church
required the Holy Communion to be celebrated at least three
times during the year; on Christmas, Easter, and Whitsunday;
and unquestionably this law was observed at Jamestown. Many
clergymen celebrated that sacrament oftener. There can be little
doubt that the first celebration of the Holy Communion at Jamestown
was on Whitsunday, May 24th (old style) 1607, although
the first one of which a record remains was held on the third
Sunday after Trinity, June 21. That was a special celebration,
held for a two-fold purpose, one, that Mr. Hunt had been able
to reconcile serious differences between certain elements among
the colonists who had been in angry strife with each other, and
second, because two of the ships which brought the colonists to
Virginia were to set sail on the following morning upon their
return trip to England.</p>

<p>William Strachey, writing in a report of the colony in 1610
after Lord De la Warr had arrived as the new governor presents
the following picture:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the midst of the market-place, a store-house, a "Corps-du-Garde",
and a pretty chapel, all which the Lord Governour ordered to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
put in good repair. The chapel was in length sixty feet, in breadth
twenty-four, and the Lord Governour had repaired it with a chancel
of cedar and a communion table of black walnut; all the pews and
pulpit were of cedar, with fair broad windows, also of cedar, to shut
and open, as the weather shall occasion. The font was hewen hollow
like a canoa, and there were two bells in the steeple at the west end.
The Church was so cast as to be very light within, and the Lord
Governour caused it to be kept passing sweet and trimmed up with
divers flowers. There was a sexton in charge of the church, and every
morning at the ringing of a bell by him, about ten o'clock, each man
addressed himself to prayers, and so at four of the clock before supper.
There was a sermon every Thursday and two sermons every
Sunday, the two preachers taking their weekly turns. Every Sunday
when the Lord Governour went to church he was accompanied with
all the Councillors, Captains, other officers, and all the gentlemen,
and with a guard of fifty halberdiers, in his Lordship's livery, fair
red cloaks, on each side and behind him. The Lord Governour sat
in the choir in a green velvet chair, with a velvet cushion before him
on which he knelt, and the Council, Captains and officers sat on
each side of him, each in their place; and when the Lord Governour
returned home he was waited on in the same manner to his house.</p></div>

<p>Reverend Alexander Whitaker, the first rector of the City of
Henrico from its foundation in 1611 until his death by drowning
in 1617, and who is still remembered as the clergyman who
baptized the Indian princess Pocahontas, after her conversion to
the Christian faith, described his services as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Every Sabbath we preach in the forenoon and catechize in the
afternoon. Every Saturday at night I exercise in Sir Thomas Dale's
house. Our Church affaires be consulted on by the minister and four
of the most religious men. Once every month we have a communion,
and once every year a solemn fast.</p></div>

<p>This method of daily and Sunday services, as the regular rule
of the Church of England, was adopted in Virginia as far as
colonial conditions would permit. But apart from Jamestown itself,
and the schools which came into existence, there would not
be many parishes in which daily services would be feasible. The
people lived too far apart on their farms. They might drive or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
walk three or five miles to Church on Sundays, but could not
give the time for that on work-days. The same objection worked
against having two services on Sunday. So the custom became
general of having a single service in every church and chapel
every Sunday. The statement made by Rev. Alexander Whitaker,
that he "catechized" every Sabbath afternoon, is illustrative of the
usual method of instructing young people of the parish in the
Church Catechism as preparation for admission to the Holy Communion.
Such "catechetical classes" might be held as frequently
on Sunday afternoons as the needs of the parish children, both
white and Negro, might require: or perhaps sometimes, as frequently
as the zeal, or lack of zeal of the incumbent minister
might determine. When in 1724 the Bishop of London sent a
questionary to every Anglican clergyman incumbent of a parish
in America, one of the questions was, "At what times do you
Catechize the Youth of your Parish?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="blockquot"><p>They have builded many pretty villages, faire houses and chapels
which are growne good benefices of 120 pounds a yeare besides their
own mundall [mundane] industry.</p></div>

<p>So wrote Captain John Smith a number of years after his return
to England. There may have been an excess of imagination
in describing new and raw settlements as "faire villages," but
the salary which was to be paid to the ministers was a provable
fact. Tithes from the culture of the land by the parishioners
amounted to as much as £120, and the minister had a glebe of
100 acres from the cultivation of which his tenants and servants
through "mundall industry" might greatly increase his income.</p>

<p>The London Company had carried to Virginia and fixed for
the whole duration of the colonial period the parish system of
the Church of England. Under that system each community
became a parish and the people of the parish, as the land-owners
of the community, supported the church and paid the salary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the minister by tithes from the produce of the land. There was,
however, one change from the custom in England. There the
tithes of a parish might produce a salary for the incumbent in
any amount from ten pounds to hundreds of pounds per annum.
In Virginia the amount of the salary was fixed by the General
Assembly as a definite quantity of tobacco. There was also a
glebe farm and a residence. Those who came to Virginia brought
with them their Bible and their <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> and the
Established Church of England became the Established Church
of the Colony.</p>

<p>The all-pervading fact to be kept in mind in connection with
the development of religious organization in Virginia is that the
Church of England itself, during the period from 1600 to the
Cromwellian era 1645-1660, was in a turmoil on account of two
diverse schools of thought. One school within the Church desired
to retain all the ancient forms of creed and worship from
past centuries except those which had been perverted under the
centuries of Roman Catholic domination. The other school within
the Church desired to cast out all liturgical forms and the
surplice, and also all power of the bishops. They wished to reduce
worship to the forms of Calvinistic theology. There were
also many who desired to make the Church broad enough to
include both schools. The Calvinistic party was already forming
dissenting congregations.</p>

<p>The Brownists, later to become the Pilgrim Fathers of New
England, had already been driven out of England; and under
King James, who had turned against the Calvinists to support
the "high church" party, ecclesiastical courts were being formed
to mete out severe punishment to leaders of dissent.</p>

<p>King James had declared he would "harry the dissenters" and
force them to conform to the Established Church or be driven
from the country. England's answer to that threat was to establish
the colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island
and New Hampshire; and the constantly growing power of dissent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
resulted in civil war, in execution of King Charles I, in the
era of the Commonwealth; and in the abolition of <i>Prayer Book</i>
worship for fifteen years from every church and chapel in England.</p>

<p>In 1606 when the Virginia Company was organized the Calvinistic
party was in power in England, and there were many
Calvinists, or Puritans, as they were then called, in the universities
and elsewhere. The Virginia Company itself was under the
influence of Puritan leaders; so much so, indeed, that this fact
was one of the reasons which impelled the King to abolish the
Virginia Company. He knew the freedom of self-government
which the Company had established in Virginia and he no longer
trusted its loyalty to the Monarchy.</p>

<p>From the first settlement in 1607 the policy in Virginia was
to let no question arise between high-churchman and Calvinist.
The earlier laws required the minister of a parish to question
every newcomer as to his religious beliefs, but there is no record
of any Protestant dissenter or any Calvinist having been presented
for trial before an ecclesiastical court. It is of course known
as an historical fact that Sir Edwin Sandys labored long to secure
from the King and the Archbishop permission to bring the
Pilgrim Fathers from Holland, under the British flag again and
establish them as a "hundred" in Virginia. It is of record also
that such permission was obtained and that the Pilgrim Fathers
set forth for the Chesapeake Bay but were diverted from their
course by storms that carried them to a place which they named
Plymouth. It is of record furthermore that the Reverend Henry
Jacob, who founded the first Independent or Baptist congregation
in London, was later forced out and came to Virginia where
he found a home and peace until his death.</p>

<p>Reverend Alexander Whitaker, rector of the two adjoining
parishes of Henrico and Charles City from 1611 until 1617,
was the son of a famous Puritan divine. In a letter discussing
conditions in Virginia he said: "I marvaile much&mdash;that so few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of our English ministers that were so hot against the surplis and
subscription come hither where neither are spoken of." Whitaker
was rector of two parishes because William Wickham, the minister
of one parish, was not of Anglican ordination and could
not lawfully celebrate the Holy Communion. After the death
of Whitaker the Governor of Virginia requested the London
Company to ask the Archbishop of Canterbury to authorize Mr.
Wickham to celebrate the Sacrament, "there being no one else."
Such authorization to a clergyman of Presbyterian ordination
could have been given by the Archbishop at that time as it was
permitted then by law. Wickham was not the only minister of
Presbyterian ordination who served as incumbent of a parish
of the Established Church in Virginia. In a report made to London
in 1623 it was stated that in Virginia in 1619 "There were
three ministers with orders and two without." The "two without"
were unquestionably of Presbyterian ordination.</p>

<p>Among the first laws enacted in Virginia was one requiring
every minister who came into the colony to take the oath of
"conformity" to the Church of England. The law did not include
laymen; it was the minister only who was required to take the
oath. Later, the laws enacted by the General Assembly required
every clergyman coming into the colony to subscribe to the Articles
of the Christian Faith according to the Church of England
and to be of Anglican ordination. By reason of sheer inability
at times to provide sufficient Anglican clergymen for the parishes,
clergymen of Presbyterian ordination were permitted to serve
in Virginia parishes; and that was true throughout the whole
seventeenth century. The last Presbyterian clergyman to hold
an Anglican parish in Virginia, Rev. Andrew Jackson of Christ
Church Parish, Lancaster County, died in 1710. Throughout the
century the law required every citizen to attend the parish
church, but there was never an ecclesiastical court in which a
layman could be tried, convicted or punished as a dissenter.</p>

Making Bricks Without Straw</h2>


<p>The colony of Virginia, after the protective and guiding influence
of the Virginia Company was taken away, found itself
in an almost impossible situation so far as religious organization
was concerned. The leaders of colonial life realized all the more
clearly as time passed that King Charles I, who succeeded his
father King James I in 1625, was not the least interested in the
religious welfare of the colony. America was entirely outside the
bounds of any diocese or province in England, and consequently
there was no bishop of a diocese, or archbishop of a province
with any personal responsibility for the guidance or help of the
parishes which were being organized in the colony. The Church
in Virginia was left to itself to live or to die. It believed, according
to the teachings of the Church, that bishops were necessary
for the ordination of men to the ministry and for the performance
of the spiritual rite of confirmation, whereby alone under the
law of the Church of England baptized Christians could be admitted
to the sacrament of the Holy Communion. A bishop was
also necessary for the organization and leadership of a diocese,
which was the governing body to which every parish and congregation
must belong. But no bishop was ever sent by the
Church of England to Virginia or to any other part of America
throughout the entire colonial period.</p>

<p>The lack of a bishop left the Anglican Church, which was
the Established Church of the whole colony, unable to organize
for the enactment of its own laws or the management of its own
affairs. There being no diocesan organization the clergymen in
charge of parishes had no ecclesiastical authority over them. That
fact tended to have the effect of making each incumbent clergyman
a virtually free lance with no responsibility to an ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
superior nor community of fellowship with other clergymen
in the colony. This condition continued until near the end of
the century.</p>

<p>The General Assembly of Virginia followed the example of
the Parliament of England and asserted legislative authority by
laws for the temporal government of the Church. It divided the
occupied territory of the colony into parishes and it established
new parishes as settlement extended steadily to the westward.
Because of this fact there was never any section which was not
part of a parish, and the usual rule when a new county was to
be created was to establish a new parish covering the territory
of the proposed county before the county was created. Church
buildings might be far apart in new parishes, but no section of
Virginia in which English people were settling was without the
established forms of religious worship.</p>

<p>The General Assembly enacted laws directing the election of
laymen in every parish as the governing body of the parish in
temporal affairs. That group was called the "Vestry." It had authority
to buy land for churches, churchyards and glebe farms,
to erect church buildings and to build glebe-houses as residences
for ministers. It was also charged with the care of the poor and
the destitute sick, and orphaned children within the parish,
with the duty of providing new homes for these children in responsible
families. The money to pay for the land, the buildings,
the care of the sick and needy, the salary of the minister, and
other parish needs was collected from the parishioners through
an annual "tithe" of so many pounds of tobacco per poll. The
vestry upon occasion also had certain civil duties not within the
scope of religious organization.</p>

<p>The setting up of a vestry of laymen as temporal head of the
Church in a parish or congregation was first developed in Virginia.
It was extended later to other colonies as the Anglican
Church spread through them all, and it came over into the life
of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States. Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
as the value of the vestry has been to the whole Episcopal Church,
the vestry in Virginia was of still greater value, for by its extension
to other colonies and states it has given one of its most distinctive
features to the Church of today.</p>

<p>In England, with the exception of some few parishes formed
within the past century or so, no parish has the right to elect
its own rector. The rector is usually appointed by some institution
or individual vested with that authority which is called
"the advowson of a parish."</p>

<p>Moreover, no diocese in the Established Church of England
has the power to select its own bishop. The King as temporal
head of the Church appoints the bishops of all dioceses, and that
power is exercised for the King by his prime minister. And during
the colonial period in America the Governor of every colony
other than Virginia and Pennsylvania appointed the rector of
every Anglican parish and inducted him into office.</p>

<p>In Virginia the vestries of the parishes fought Governor after
Governor until they won the right for the vestry itself to choose
the minister to serve in its parish. That right has extended
throughout the Episcopal Church today and has gone further
so that today the laity of the Church have the right to representation
in all diocesan conventions and councils, and in the general
convention of the Church. Thus the laity have their part
in every election of a clergyman to become the bishop of a
diocese.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the General Assembly also put
into effect in Virginia the constitutions and canons of the province
of Canterbury "as far as they can be put into effect in this
country." The General Assembly thereby made the "doctrine,
discipline and worship" of the Anglican Church of England that
of the Church in Virginia as far as it could be done without a
bishop.</p>

<p>That was as far as the General Assembly could go. Throughout
all the seventeenth century the Established Church of Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
consisted of a group of parishes without connection with each
other and without central spiritual authority. There was therefore
no actual power of discipline, either of clergymen or laymen.</p>

<p>The situation was made all the more difficult because there
was no sure way to secure ministers. When a parish became
vacant some layman in the parish would have to write to his
business agent in England, or to some friend or relative there
and ask that he find a clergyman who would come to Virginia.
Parishes, when they became vacant, remained vacant as a rule
for a year or more; sometimes very much more. The vestries early
adopted the custom of appointing godly laymen as readers whose
duty it was to assist the minister by leading the congregation
in the responses in the Church service, and in raising tunes for
the singing of metrical version of the Psalms. Later, when it
was found desirable to erect chapels of ease in populous parishes,
enough readers were appointed in every parish to permit one
of them to hold morning service each Sunday in each place of
worship throughout the parish, while the minister went his
usual round of service in each church or chapel upon regular
schedule. Except in remote chapels the custom was to have service
each Sunday in every church or chapel.</p>

<p>The reader was authorized to conduct morning and evening
prayer and to read a printed sermon, or a "homily." He could not
celebrate the sacrament of Holy Communion. Rather frequently,
and especially during the era of the Commonwealth and the
reign of Charles II, several adjoining parishes would be vacant
at the same time; and at one time about the end of the Commonwealth
period the statement was made that there were only
some ten clergymen in Virginia to serve fifty parishes. Under
such circumstances the reader was called upon to perform many
duties. He might baptize a dying child, conduct a funeral, or
perform a marriage ceremony.</p>

<p>There was also in those early days no way of screening out
unworthy men who appeared occasionally as clergymen in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
colony; men who perhaps had been forced out of parishes in
England because of immorality or drunkenness; and occasionally
men with forged credentials. Such men were occasionally appointed
to parishes by vestries who had no way of learning their
true status; and if the man was thenceforth morally decent and
had no great fault except occasional drunkenness, he would be
allowed to stay on because of the need of a priest to celebrate the
sacraments.</p>

<p>The vestries protected their parishes from unworthy clergymen
by the uncanonical appointment of a minister as incumbent
of a parish for a year at a time, rather than present him canonically
to the Governor of the colony for induction into the rectorship
of the parish. Under the law of England, and under the law of
the Church of England, no rector could be forced out of a parish
after induction except after an ecclesiastical trial by the bishop
or his commissary.</p>

<p>In 1656 John Hammond published a pamphlet entitled <i>Leah
and Rachel</i>, extolling the attractiveness of Virginia and Maryland
as places of residence at that time. He described vividly
the difficulties which the older colony had suffered in the earlier
years of Charles I. He wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They then began to provide and send home for Gospel ministers,
and largely contributed for their maintenance. But Virginia savouring
not handsomely in England, very few of good conversation would adventure
thither, (as thinking it a place wherein surely the fear of
God was not), yet many came, such as wore black coats, and could
babble in a pulpet, roare in a tavern, exact from their parishioners,
and rather by their dissolutenesse destroy than feed their flocks.</p>

<p>Loath was the country to be wholly without teachers, and therefore
rather retain these than to be destitute; yet still endeavours for better
in their places, which were obtained, and these wolves in sheeps
cloathing, by their Assemblies questioned, silenced, and some forced
to depart the country.</p></div>

<p>Another problem which the Church faced in Virginia resulted
from the character of the immigrants who came to the colony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
It is a well established fact that the men who came in three
ships to Jamestown in 1607 were from various strata of society
in England. They all entered James River on equality of opportunity
and of danger. Some at least had come from the higher
classes of society; younger sons, perhaps, or relatives of stockholders
in the London Company, attracted to Virginia because
of the newness of the adventure and the spice of danger; sons
of professional men and men of business, intrigued by a new
business life and opportunity; men from the laboring classes
and the peasantry of rural sections. But it is extremely doubtful
that the Jamestown settlement, after its tragic first years, continued
very long to be attractive to young men seeking adventure
only. Many of the families of today who boast of their generations
of ancestry in Virginia descend from or married into the
families of the men and women who came to the colony in these
earliest years of settlement, and have ancestors buried among
the unknown dead of the Jamestown cemetery and churchyard.</p>

<p>There were three sources from which the settlers came; and
these sources were more or less in effect throughout the whole
of Virginia's first century. First and foremost in numbers and
importance were the sons of small farmers and tenant farmers,
and younger sons of the laboring classes and small merchants.
No matter how large the population may be, always there are
positions of employment with a normal wage; but when the
younger sons of a mechanic or other working man grow to maturity
where there is only one wage-producing employment available
to the family, the younger sons must seek a living from other
sources. Farms cannot be reduced below the number of acres
required to support one family. When that has been done and
there are several sons, one of them must inherit the farm and
the others must seek a living elsewhere.</p>

<p>The broad acres of Virginia and its equable climate attracted
thousands of such younger sons, and also others who had not
been successful and sought opportunity in a new land. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
settlers came from every section of England, and from the bleak
hills of Scotland; from Wales and also from Ireland. The English
were mostly from the Anglican parishes of the Established
Church. The Scottish new-comers were accustomed to membership
in the Established Church of Scotland and they found little
difficulty in living within the Established Church of Virginia.
Indeed there is no recorded effort to establish a Presbyterian
congregation in Virginia until the last quarter of the seventeenth
century. So friendly was the feeling between the Anglicans and
the Scottish Presbyterians in the Norfolk section that Rev. James
Porter of Presbyterian ordination was the incumbent minister
of the Anglican Lynnhaven Parish prior to 1676 and until his
death in 1683.</p>

<p>A second source, certainly in the early years, was the rapidly
increasing population of the cities and towns of England. It
is of record that in the days of the London Company one town
appropriated funds sufficient to pay the expenses to Virginia of
a large number of its unemployed, and probably the same thing
was done by other towns for their unemployed. Doubtless a little
"pressure" was applied in the case of young men who had no occupation
and no visible means of support. And shanghaiing, to
use a modern term, was not unknown.</p>

<p>A third source from which settlers came developed from the
custom which grew up in England of sending to Virginia, and
later to all the colonies, persons who had been convicted of law-breaking.
At that time there were some hundred felonies in the
English code of jurisprudence for which the sentence of death
by hanging could be imposed. These felonies included such offenses
as stealing a pig or anything of greater value than a shilling.
The ruling classes of England had long realized that punishments
were too severe for offenses which today would be misdemeanors;
and in the fifteenth century an effort had been made
to mitigate the severity of punishment by an amendment of the
law of "benefit of clergy." This law was a law of Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
which had come down from earlier ages of the Church. Under
that law an ecclesiastical person, either priest or monk, who
was charged with a felony could not be tried by a civil court
but was delivered up to the bishop of his diocese for trial in an
ecclesiastical court.</p>

<p>By the end of the sixteenth century Parliament had amended
the benefit of clergy law so that every free male who could read
and write, upon conviction of a first offense of felony might
plead "benefit of clergy", and upon showing that he could read
a verse of Scripture, have the penalty remitted. He was then
burned in the hand with a hot iron so that the scar thereby made
would be evidence against him if he should plead benefit of
clergy a second time.</p>

<p>The benefit of clergy law was early written into the Virginia
code and continued in that code until after the Revolution. Harsh
as was the law it showed a real effort to ameliorate still harsher
laws, and it saved the lives in England and America of many
thousands of first offenders. The first verse of the fifty-first Psalm
was so frequently presented to be read by some convicted man
or boy that it became known as the "neck verse" because it saved
a life; and many a kindly official taught a 'teen-age boy that
verse so that he could "read" it when it was presented to him.</p>

<p>One of the earliest records of the General Court of Virginia
contains the following entry under date January 4, 1628/29:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>William Reade, aged thirteen or fourteen years, convicted of manslaughter,
when the verdict was read, and William Reade asked what
he had to say for himself, that he ought not to die, demanded his
clergy, whereupon he was delivered to the Ordinary.</p></div>

<p>There were many such instances. In Virginia the Governor
was the Ordinary and as such had authority to accept the boy's
plea, have him read the "neck verse," and thereby permit him
to go free "after the burning."</p>

<p>The severity of the laws influenced the courts in many parts
of England to permit or sentence an offender to escape death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
by going to one of the American colonies, and it became the
custom to sentence convicted criminals to serve for a period of
years in an American colony as an indentured servant. A great
number of such "convicts" were sent to Virginia because of the
constant demand there for indentured servants to cultivate the
fields and for other duties.</p>

<p>Many of the convicts became useful citizens of the colony
after their terms of servitude ended; but many did not reform
and in time became such a menace that for a period after 1670
the General Assembly forbade that any more convicts be brought
into the colony.</p>

<p>It can be seen therefore that from the beginning the population
of Virginia grew by immigration from various sources and
that not all who came to the colony were of the best type. The
New England colonies had the advantage that their immigrants
came in large part from dissenters from the Established Church
of England. They came for "conscience sake," however, and
with their concept of theocratic government the New England
colonists could make it difficult indeed for immigrants they
did not welcome. After Roger Williams had been exiled to
Rhode Island and a few Quakers had been hanged on Boston
Common, it was made clear to Baptists and Quakers, to Anglicans
and to witches that Virginia was a more favorable climate for
them than Massachusetts.</p>

<p>In contrast to New England, Virginia was founded and developed
as a cross-section of the whole life of the British Isles,
with its evil as well as its good; with ideals of freedom of thought
which made no attempt to control a man's conscience; and with
an ever growing concept of self-government and human freedom
as already developed during nearly a thousand years and set out
by the common law and the statute law of the race. Virginia
was not founded upon any theocratic concept of government
under the influence of a priestly class.</p>

<p>The life and community consciousness that developed in Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
into the distinctive customs and ways of a well organized
and firmly established commonwealth were necessarily different
from those of the colonies in New England because of the differing
conditions under which men lived. In the township system
of New England a village normally became the township center
and the people lived near enough to each other to enable them
to meet frequently; to work and play together; to transact business;
and to gossip of neighborhood affairs. In Virginia it was
otherwise. In Virginia families lived on separate farms and each
farm was of necessity a community within itself. Life was geared
to the basic fact that tobacco was the money crop, and also was
the real source of the financial strength and stability of the colony.
Each family required a farm of sufficient acreage to raise tobacco
as well as food-stuff and cattle; and throughout the whole colonial
period the genius of Virginian life opposed the development of
towns of greater population than was required for a shipping
point and a warehouse, for the storing and grading of tobacco,
and for a few agents of English and Scottish merchants.</p>

Building a Christian Community</h2>


<p>John Hammond, in his pamphlet <i>Leah and Rachel</i> sketched
briefly conditions which existed in Virginia between the "starving
time" of 1609-10 and the year 1656. His attempt was to correct
an opinion widely held in England of the lawlessness of colonial
life. He interpreted the great massacre of 1622 as the end of
one phase and the beginning of another. He showed that in each
phase there was an inevitable period of laxity of life and disregard
of moral and legal conventions which was overcome finally
by the better element of citizenry. His writing presents a dark
picture of conditions, possibly too dark in some phases; but his
picture of the power of the growing colony to establish and maintain
general concepts of decency of life and conduct is impressive.</p>

<p>Of the period following the great massacre he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Receiving a supply of men, ammunition and victuals out of England,
they again gathered heart, pursued their enemies, and so often
worsted them, that the Indians were glad to sue for peace, and they,
(desirous of a cessation) consented to it.</p>

<p>They again began to bud forth, to spread further, to gather wealth,
which they rather profusely spent (as gotten with ease) than providently
husbanded, or aimed at any public good; or to make a
country for posterity; but from hand to mouth, and for a present
being; neglecting discoveries, planting orchards, providing for the
winter preservation of their stocks, or thinking of anything stable or
firm; and whilst tobacco, the only commodity they had to subsist
on, bore a price, they wholly and eagerly followed that, neglecting
their very planting of corn, and much relyed on England for the
chiefest part of their provisions; so that being not alwayes amply
supplied, they were often in such want, that their case and condition
being relayted in England, it hindred and kept off many from going
thither, who rather cast their eyes on the barren and freezing soyle
of New-England, than to joyn with such an indigent and sottish
people as were reported to be in Virginia.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet was not Virginia all this while without divers honest and
vertuous inhabitants, who, observing the general neglect and licensiousnesses
there, caused Assemblies to be call'd and laws to be
made tending to the glory of God, the severe suppression of vices,
and the compelling them not to neglect (upon strickt punishments)
planting and tending such quantities of corn, as would not onely
serve themselves, their cattle and hogs plentifully, but to be enabled
to supply New-England (then in want) with such proportions, as
were extream reliefs to them in their necessities.</p>

<p>From this industry of theirs and great plenty of corn, (the main
staffe of life), proceeded that great plenty of cattle and hogs, (now
innumerable) and out of which not only New-England hath been
stocked and relieved, but all others parts of the Indies inhabited by
Englishmen.</p>

<p>The inhabitants now finding the benefit of their industries, began
to look with delight on their increasing stocks; (as nothing more
pleasurable than profit), to take pride in their plentifully furnished
tables, to grow not onely civil, but great observers of the Sabbath, to
stand upon their reputations, and to be ashamed of that notorious
manner of life they had formerly lived and wallowed in....</p>

<p>Then began the Gospel to flourish, civil, honourable, and men
of great estates flocked in; famous buildings went forward, orchards
innumerable were planted and preserved; tradesmen set on work and
encouraged, staple commodities, as silk, flax, pot-ashes, etc., of
which I shall speak further hereafter, attempted on, and with good
success brought to perfection; so that this country which had a mean
beginning, many back friends, two ruinous and bloody massacres,
hath by God's grace out-grown all, and is become a place of pleasure
and plenty.</p></div>

<p>It may possibly be worthwhile to compare the life of Virginia
during its first two generations with the far west of the United
States from the gold-rush days of 1849 to the end of the nineteenth
century. There again, as in the Virginia of 1607, bona
fide settlers of moral ideals and stability of life prevailed in the
long run and developed self-governing states which maintained
the moral code.</p>

<p>But Virginia had an advantage which the far west of the gold-rush
days lacked. Virginia had an Established Church which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
in spite of its own problems and difficulties created a parish in
every section, and provided clergymen as far as they could be
obtained. It is granted that some at least of the clergymen were
unworthy. The vestries themselves ejected men of that kind and
services could be maintained by readers. And so the Word of
God was read and prayer was offered regularly; and every man
who could read had the Ten Commandments staring him in the
face from the tablets on the wall behind the Holy Table. The
individual might scorn and sneer but in the end the Law of
God became the law of the community.</p>

<p>Men came to church in those early days. For one reason, the
law of the colony required it and there was the threat of punishment
if absence from church was reported to the grand jury. But
there was another reason also, even though men and women
were compelled to walk five or six miles to attend. That other
reason was the loneliness of farm life in the early days of colonial
Virginia. The churchyard on a Sunday morning was then the
meeting-place of the whole community, and the only place where
all could meet on the same level. The only other meetings were
when elections were held at the Court House, every three or
four years. And men might attend the meetings of the county
court; but women could not vote, and they did not go to elections;
nor were they apt to attend meetings of the county court
except in rare instances when they were engaged in litigation.
And the amount of hard liquor consumed on election days and
county court days was also a deterrent.</p>

<p>Before the day of parish aid societies and women's guilds, the
church service of a Sunday morning was moreover the only
meeting to which everybody might come as of right; and while at
church the women discussed affairs and neighbors within the
church building the men outside walked about or sat on stumps
or logs and held their discussions before and after the service hour.</p>

<p>The church with its churchyard was the public forum at which
matters of public policy and public interest were discussed. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
was here also that business was transacted; and it was here that
community spirit of fellowship, of sympathy and of understanding
was developed. The colonial government recognized all this
by directing that every public communication which had to be
brought to the attention of the people as a whole be read to the
congregation of every church or chapel in the colony. And the
Church recognized the same thing by providing that such announcements
should be made immediately after the reading of
the second lesson or New Testament lesson in the morning service.
The approaching worshipper never knew what interesting
announcement might be made at that time; so there was always
an element of expectancy and suspense; perhaps an announcement
of the banns of matrimony; perhaps the reading of a new law, or
of some proclamation by the Governor and Council; perhaps the
baptism of a baby, or even a marriage.</p>

<p>So it was that men and women of all classes came under the
influence of Christian teaching whether they would or no; and
the constant teaching and stressing of moral and Christian ideals
of life had their effect in changing and improving the character
of the community life.</p>

The Coming of the Negro</h2>


<p>A new element came early into the life of Virginia, with
permanent and continuous hurt to the welfare of the colony and
later to the Commonwealth; an element to which the colony
was compelled to adapt itself because it did not have the power
to eradicate it after men perceived its danger. It was the element
of human slavery.</p>

<p>The first Negro captives were brought into the port of Jamestown
in the year 1619. They were brought by a foreign ship
then described as a "Dutch" ship, but presumably a Portuguese
slaver seeking the enlargement of his market. The Portuguese
had developed a market for Negro slaves in the Spanish colonies
in the Caribbean where the enslaved Indians proved unable to
perform the hard work demanded of them. Unhappily the slavers
succeeded in widening their market to include Virginia and the
other English colonies of the American continent and in the
West Indies.</p>

<p>The first Negroes were brought to Jamestown in 1619 and sold
to English masters as indentured servants. As such they were
required to serve for a definite number of years and after that
they would become freemen entitled to all the benefit of Virginia
law. The goal set before them, as before immigrants from France
and the Netherlands, was eventual freedom and naturalization
as full citizens.</p>

<p>The tragedy of the Negro was that he had been procured by
the Portuguese as a captive taken in war between the native
Negro tribes, and he came into the life of Virginia utterly ignorant
of every British ideal of human freedom and government under
constitutional law. He knew nothing of the English language.
The indentured Englishman or Scotsman who was sold into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
service came with inherited knowledge of Anglo-Saxon ideals of
civil government and Christian faith; and the one great goal set
before him was that he could become a legal citizen of Virginia
after he completed his years of servitude. The Negro knew nothing
of all this.</p>

<p>There would have been little difficulty if the few Negroes in
the first ship had been all who came. The government could have
provided for their care and for their instruction in English ideals
and the Christian faith. But they were not all who came. The
first indentured Negroes proved useful as hewers of wood and
drawers of water, and they were capable of far more work in the
fields than many of the Englishmen: and so the agrarian needs
of the community where all men were farmers made the governmental
authorities willing to admit more Negroes.</p>

<p>The authorities must have realized at once that if Negroes
were brought into the colony in great number they could not be
permitted to become freemen after any period of indenture. That
would have brought into the life of Virginia a steadily growing
population of men and women who knew nothing of English
institutions, or of the English language, or of the Christian religion.
The welfare of the colony required that if they were to
be admitted at all, they could be admitted only as servants under
a permanent status of servitude. So slavery was introduced into
the British empire; and in America the enslavement of the Negro
was permitted in New England as well as in Virginia, the Carolinas
and in Georgia.</p>

<p>That was the first act in the great tragedy of Negro slavery in
America. The second was that the enslavement and sale of Negroes
proved so profitable that the people of England entered
into it by chartering the Royal African Company, with authority
to purchase captive Negroes throughout a large portion of Africa
which was assigned to the Company for that purpose. At one
time at least the King of England owned stock in the Company;
and he gave his instruction to the royal Governors of American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
colonies that they should not permit the passage through a colonial
legislature of any act which would interfere with the right
to import Negroes and sell them into slavery within the colony.</p>

<p>The third act in the tragedy was that after Virginia and perhaps
other colonies had made many unavailing efforts to check
or forbid by legislation the bringing of more Negroes from Africa,
the War of American Independence was fought and won. In the
Constitutional Convention of the new sovereign states called to
create a Federal Union of them all, the representatives of Virginia
and other states fought bitterly for an immediate prohibition
against further importation of Negro slaves, only to be defeated
by the cotton-growing interests of some states and the
shipping interests of others who demanded that the trade be continued
for a period of years. And so the Constitution of the
United States when first put into effect in the Federal Union
permitted for twenty years the importation of captive Negroes
from Africa and their sale into slavery.</p>

<p>The increase in the number of Negro slaves in those states
where their labor proved profitable brought with it the constant
fear of a Negro insurrection; a fear that continued until the
ending of slavery in this country. The presence of the Negroes
and of English convicts sold into servitude made it impossible
upon any large plantation for the women and children of the
master's household ever to be left without the protection of a
slave-master who had the power of gun and lash to protect them
from harm.</p>

<p>The preaching of the Christian faith to the heathen Indians,
which was so strongly present in the purposes of the London
Company at the first settlement of Virginia, must have been
considered when the custom of admitting Negro slaves began
but there is no recorded evidence bearing upon that subject. If
there had been a bishop in the colony he could have made the
conversion of the Negro to Christianity an important part of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
diocesan program; but without a bishop nothing could be done
in an organized way. The matter was perforce left to the consciences
of the incumbent ministers of the several parishes.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that every first generation of the slaves
had come to America as captives taken in war of one tribe against
another. Their languages and dialects included perhaps every
language in central and southern Africa; and their unfamiliar
languages made it almost impossible for the average citizen or
his parson to do much in the way of preaching the Christian
faith; except perhaps in the observance of the universal law of
kindness.</p>

<p>The birth of slave children, however, removed the barrier of
language, for the children were taught English as their native
tongue. The children therefore could be taught. All teaching of
children, whether children of the master and mistress or those
born as their slaves, was considered the duty of the whole family.
And the teaching of the catechism and the duties of a Christian
life to the slave children was as important a part of the family
responsibility in a Christian home as the teaching of the children
of the family itself. No clergyman of the Church would be willing
to baptize a slave child unless there were responsible sponsors
present who would assume the obligation to give steady Christian
teaching. So it became a rule of the clergy, or most of them, that
the master and mistress in the case of each such baptism must
assume the obligation to give the child Christian training. The
baptized children could then in early youth be permitted to attend
the instruction classes which were held by the incumbent minister
for them. The slave child and the master's child would share
the privilege of admission to the Sacrament of the Holy Communion
when each one had shown sufficient knowledge and
understanding of right and wrong, and had been sufficiently
instructed in "the things which a Christian should know and
believe." No one knows how many or what percentage of slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
children in Virginia or elsewhere were baptized, or how many
became communicants because no record was kept. But there
were enough baptisms to create a new problem.</p>

<p>There was no Negro slavery in England, and it was generally
understood that when a Negro slave set foot upon the soil of
England he became a free man. Somehow that concept of freedom
became linked in common thinking with the concept of
baptism into the Christian faith; and there arose in practically
every slave-holding section of the English colonies a question
whether the very act of baptizing a slave child did not set him
free from slavery. Because of that question many slave-owners
declined to permit the baptism of their slaves until the question
was settled, and consequently in every slave-owning colony it
became necessary to secure a legislative enactment establishing
the legal status of a baptized slave. The question arose in Virginia,
and in 1667 the following act was adopted by the General Assembly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whereas some doubts have risen whether children that are slaves
by birth, and by the charity and piety of their owners made partakers
of the blessed sacrament of baptisme, should by virtue of their
baptisme be made free; <i>It is enacted and declared by this Grand
Assembly and the authority thereof</i>, that the conferring of baptisme
doth not alter the condition of the person as to his bondage or freedom;
that diverse masters, freed from this doubt, may more carefully
endeavour the propagation of Christianity by permitting children,
though slaves, or those of greater growth if capable to be admitted
to that sacrament.</p></div>

<p>The question was settled likewise throughout all the slave-holding
colonies of England, and human slavery was written
into the laws of the various colonies of the British empire, there
to remain until the ideals of the nineteenth century eliminated
it from the constitution and the laws of every English-speaking
nation.</p>

<p>The following incidents, although they occurred in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
half of the eighteenth century, outside the period covered by this
booklet, are yet of such interest in the continuing story of Negro
slavery as to be worth recording here.</p>

<p>In 1724 the Bishop of London, Edmund Gibson, sent a questionary
to the incumbent minister of every Anglican parish in the
American colonies. Among the questions he asked were two; one
inquiring how many "infidels," either Indians or Negroes, there
were in each parish; and two, what efforts were being made to
convert them to the Christian faith. The answers revealed a
serious situation, and the need of more definite and better organized
efforts to convert the Negroes.</p>

<p>The first effort made by the Bishop of London was as strong a
pastoral letter as he could write upon the need of more earnest
effort to bring the Negro slaves into the Christian faith. He also
prepared a pamphlet to be used for the instruction of Negroes.
His pastoral letter and his pamphlet were sent to every incumbent
minister, and copies were given to the heads of families.</p>

<p>Another effort was the organization in England in 1723 by the
Rev. Thomas Bray of a company called "Dr. Bray's Associates."
Dr. Thomas Bray was the bishop's commissary to the province
of Maryland. The purpose of Dr. Bray's Associates was to establish
in the colonies schools for the education and Christian instruction
of Negro children, and it did a useful work. It did a
notable work in the City of New York, and it conducted schools
in other places; one of them at Williamsburg, in Virginia.</p>

<p>There was another and most unusual development in Virginia.
Under the urge of the Bishop of London's pastoral letter there
came a great increase in the number of baptisms of adult Negroes;
so sudden an increase as to cause concern to Commissary
Blair and to Governor Gooch. In some way a report had spread
among the Negroes that ex-Governor Alexander Spotswood, upon
his return from a voyage to England, had brought with him an
order from the King directing that all baptized Negro slaves be
set free. The story, improbable as it was to English ears, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
believed implicitly by the Negroes and it brought many of them
to their parish clergy seeking for baptism. Time passed and there
was no movement to set the baptized Negroes free. They became
indignant, for they believed the colonial authorities had ignored
the King's order. A plot for a Negro uprising was formed; but
the plot was discovered and the ringleaders were punished.</p>

<p>Another incident occurred two years later. A woman slave who
had been baptized was convicted of manslaughter in the Gloucester
County Court which sentenced her to death. She thereupon
plead the benefit of clergy. Her plea brought a new problem to
the courts of Virginia for until that time no woman and no slave
in the colony had ever been permitted to plead benefit of clergy.
The County Court considered the plea and the vote was a tie
between granting the plea and enforcement of the sentence. The
County Court referred the matter to the General Court of the
colony; and there again the vote resulted in a tie. The General
Court therefore referred the case to the Attorney General of
England. Meanwhile, the General Court ordered that the woman's
plea be granted, and, in order not to set a precedent in an
unsettled question, directed that she be sold out of the colony.
At a subsequent meeting of the General Assembly the matter
was settled so far as Virginia was concerned by enactment of a
law that all persons convicted of a first offense of felony, whether
male or female, bond or free, might plead benefit of clergy.</p>

<p>Slavery existed in the American colonies from Massachusetts
and Connecticut to Virginia and the Carolinas at the end of the
seventeenth century. It was alien to English ideals of human freedom.
Yet out of it all one tremendously important fact has come
to pass. The Negro came to America from almost every Negro
tribe and dialect in central and southern Africa; he came without
any connection except his connection with other slaves when
more than one were sold to the same master. He came into a
highly developed civilization with great organized power of leadership
and government; and through the generations of slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the Negro in America wrought for himself a national and racial
consciousness within the sphere of American life. The American
Negro today is the most highly educated and the most advanced
Negro in the world. As such he has the opportunity to make his
own contribution to the culture and the civilization of the world.
This their centuries of slavery and repression have brought them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_SIX" id="CHAPTER_SIX"></a>CHAPTER SIX<br /><br />

Fighting Adverse Conditions</h2>


<p>The political conditions in England throughout the middle of
the seventeenth century bore heavily upon Virginia in religious
as well as in civil matters. The period of civil war which began
in 1642 lasted until the King was captured by the parliamentary
forces, and Archbishop Laud, the hated persecutor of dissenters,
was beheaded. After an imprisonment of four years the king was
beheaded and Oliver Cromwell reigned as Protector of the Commonwealth.
The civil war had lined up the dissenting bodies in
England, and the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, against the
King and the Church of England.</p>

<p>On the American scene the Puritan colonies in New England
were in hearty sympathy with the dissenters in England. In Virginia
the government and the great body of the people were in
equal sympathy with King Charles and the Established Church.
It is true there were in Virginia the goodly number of several
hundred Puritan settlers. In the Church also there was some
Puritan sympathy among a small group of the clergy. One of
these, indeed, the Rev. Thomas Harrison, who became minister
of Elizabeth River Parish (Norfolk) in 1640, was presented for
trial in the county court in April 1645 "For not reading the Book
of Common Prayer, and not administering the sacrament of baptism
according to the canons and order prescribed, and for not
catechizing on Sunday in the afternoon, according to the Act of
Assembly." He was banished to Massachusetts in 1648, where he
remained for two years and married. Afterward he returned to
England and was given official position in the Commonwealth
under Cromwell.</p>

<p>In the heated atmosphere of the times the Puritan group in
Virginia took occasion to apply to the Puritan church government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
in Massachusetts to send three ordained Puritan "missionaries"
to their fellow religionists in Virginia, but upon the arrival of
the missionaries their ship was met by government officials; the
three missionaries sent back to Massachusetts; and the master of
the ship was fined for bringing them to the colony. No one in
official position in Virginia could escape the conviction that the
sending of Puritan ministers to Virginia at such a time, whether
upon request of the Nansemond River group or upon suggestion
from Boston, was for any purpose other than to foment and organize
Puritan opposition to the King. For that reason Puritanism
in Virginia came under suspicion, and the Governor, Sir William
Berkeley, with the full support of the government and public
opinion, treated all Puritans as enemies. He made their situation
so intolerable that the entire group accepted an invitation from
the proprietor of the Province of Maryland and migrated to that
colony. There, given land on the Severn River, they gained control
of the provincial government within a few years. The forcing
of the group out of Virginia was a political act of defense and
was not religious persecution.</p>

<p>The English Parliament in 1645 enacted a law abolishing the
Church of England as an active organization. The law enacted
by Parliament drove every bishop from his diocese, and forbade
the use of the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> in any church or chapel
in England. The rectors of over two thousand parishes were
forced out and their places were filled by Presbyterian and Independent
or Baptist ministers.</p>

<p>The General Assembly of Virginia, upon learning the action
of Parliament, adopted an act in 1647 requiring the use of the
<i>Prayer Book</i> in every church and chapel in Virginia each Sunday
in the regular forms prescribed in the <i>Prayer Book</i>. The Act
made further provision that in every parish in which the incumbent
minister disobeyed the law and continued disuse of the
<i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, his parishioners were thereby absolved
from paying him any further salary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>In England marriage was held to be a religious service to be
performed by no one other than a priest of the Church; and
Parliament, after abolishing the Prayer Book and the canons of
the Anglican Church, was compelled to enact another law making
provision for the performance of the marriage ceremony as
a civil contract. The new law directed that justices of the local
courts perform marriages and record them, if desired, in the court
records. The people of Virginia paid no attention to this law
except, as far as is known, in one case in Northumberland County.
In the year 1656 a man and woman in Lancaster County, instead
of going to the minister, if there were one, or to the reader
of the parish, went to a county official of Northumberland and
were married according to the Act of Parliament. Their marriage
was recorded in the court order book and there nine months later
the new incumbent, Samuel Cole of Lancaster, found it. He
thereupon declared openly that the law of Virginia was in effect
in his parish and not the Acts of Parliament. The affair ended
when the parson required the wedded couple to consider themselves
unwed until he could announce the banns of matrimony
for them on three separate Sundays and then perform a Christian
marriage. He then took occasion to go to the Northumberland
county court and record his certificate of marriage of the
couple in the court order book. The two certificates still appear
in the order book of the county court of Northumberland County
in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Certificate of Marriage, 11 Sept. 1656. John Merryday [i.e., Meredith]
and Mrs. Ann Nash, als. Mallet, were married by Coll. Jno. Trussell,
according to Act of Parliament, 24 August, 1653. Witnesses Geo.
Colclough, Leonard Spencer and Jno. Carter. Rec. 20 Sept. 1656.</p>

<p>To all such whom it may concern. These are to certifie that John

Law, were married at Currotomon on the 14th of this instant July,

certificate was recorded.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>The colony of Virginia in affairs of both church and state
exercised more independence of action under the Commonwealth
than it ever exercised before or afterward until the Declaration
of Independence in 1776. The General Assembly, after
it made a treaty of peace with Cromwell's commissioners, elected
the several governors of the colony until the Restoration of
Charles Second in 1660 took that authority from them. The
Burgesses had agreed to discontinue the use of prayers for the
King and the royal family in public services, and the General
Assembly enacted a law directing each parish to decide for
itself whether it would continue or discontinue the use of the
<i>Book of Common Prayer</i>. All questions of parish administration
were left to the several vestries. If a parish did not wish to use
the old form of worship it might use such form as it desired.</p>

<p>A number of ministers of Presbyterian ordination, and some
openly acknowledged Puritans thereupon came into the colony
and these became incumbent ministers of parishes. The last
known one was the Rev. Andrew Jackson, incumbent of Christ
Church Parish in Lancaster County from some years after 1680
until his death in 1711. He was a godly and devout minister, beloved
by his parishioners. Tradition says that he "stood up to
read the Psalms, but remained seated when they said the Creed."</p>

<p>For twenty-five or thirty years prior to 1675, to the distress of
the Church and the people as a whole, there was a desperate lack
of ordained ministers, and inability, to get clergymen from England.
Some few, driven out of parishes in England by the Parliamentary
victors, did come to Virginia, but never in sufficient
number to supply the need. Then, after the restoration of Charles,
II, in 1660 and the return of the Anglican Church to active life,
there were so many parishes in England from which non-conforming
ministers were removed because of refusal to use the
<i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, that for nearly a decade there were
almost no clergymen to send overseas. Conditions did begin to
improve, however, before the end of the decade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>The improvement increased more rapidly after a new bishop of
London came into that diocese in 1675 and manifested active interest
in the affairs of the parishes in America.</p>

<p>During the decade 1660-70, shortly after King Charles had
been received and crowned King of England, the General Assembly
of Virginia made earnest effort to call the attention of the
Crown and the people of England to the needs of the Church
in the colony. A committee of clergymen was sent from Jamestown
to London to present the matter to the King. The committee
published a pamphlet telling of the great need and urging a
definite programme to help improve religious conditions. Three
things ought to be done: first, a bishop should be sent at once to
visit the parishes and ordain as deacons devout laymen who had
been serving as readers so that there would be at least a deacon in
every parish; second, fellowships ought to be established at the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge for the support and training
of men for the ministry who would agree to serve the Church
for a term of years in the parishes of Virginia; third, and most
important, a bishop ought to be consecrated to organize a diocese
in Virginia and bring the parishes there into the full life of the
Anglican Church.</p>

<p>No one knows what influence the pamphlet had in arousing
interest. Certainly no bishop was sent to ordain readers as deacons;
and no fellowships were established at the universities to train
men to serve in the ministry in Virginia. But a movement did
start to organize a diocese and consecrate a bishop. This occurred
after 1670. The movement won approval and a charter was prepared
for the signature of King Charles as the temporal head of
the Church. The charter provided that the diocese was to be
called the Diocese of Virginia, and Jamestown was to become
the see-city where the bishop was to have his "Cathedral." A
clergyman was selected by the King to become the new bishop.
He was the Reverend Alexander Moray who had fled Scotland
with Prince Charles and had gone as chaplain with the ill-fated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
campaign ending in defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1652 in
which Prince Charles sought to win his throne from the Parliamentary
conquerors. Mr. Moray then fled to Virginia and became
rector of Ware Parish in Gloucester County.</p>

<p>But something happened in 1672 after the King had announced
publicly that he had selected Mr. Moray to be bishop.
Nobody knows what it was, but the charter was never signed,
and Mr. Moray was not made a bishop. There is some evidence
that he died just at that time and possibly that caused the plan
to fall through.</p>

<p>It would seem probable that the failure of the plan in 1672
aroused the interest of Henry Compton who became Bishop of
London in 1675, for in that same year he secured from the Crown
authority to select and license men to serve as ministers of the
parishes in America. And shortly thereafter a fund called "The
King's Bounty" was established, from which each clergyman
licensed to serve in America was given twenty pounds sterling
to pay the cost of his voyage. This plan continued until the American
Revolution. It did great good, for it gave to every Anglican
clergyman in the colonies a bishop whom he felt he knew, and
to whom he could write if necessary. The Bishop of London
never at any time had any authority whatsoever over the laity of
the Church in America, nor over the work of the vestries as
temporal heads of the parishes. But his influence with the clergy
was of enormous value to their morale.</p>

<p>Ten years later Bishop Compton went farther and secured
authority to appoint clergymen as his personal representatives in
the colonies; to confer with the clergy; and, if necessary, to remove
from their parishes clergymen who had proven to be unworthy
men. The commissaries lost their power some sixty years
later when a new Bishop of London appointed in 1748 refused
to give his commissaries the authority which earlier commissaries
had exercised.</p>

<p>The first commissaries, James Blair for Virginia and Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Bray for Maryland, made great contribution to the life of the
Church of England in the colonies and in England also. Commissary
Bray was the moving spirit in organizing three missionary
societies in England: the Society for the Propagation of Christian
Knowledge; the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
Foreign Parts; and, in his old age, the society of Dr. Bray's Associates
for ministry to Negro slaves in all the colonies. He also
instituted a plan for sending libraries of theological books to
parishes in the colonies, an enormous help to clergymen in far-off
places.</p>

<p>James Blair served as Commissary in Virginia from his appointment
in 1689 until his death in 1743. His greatest work
was the establishment and development of the Royal College
of William and Mary in 1693. He raised money for its establishment
first by asking pledges from all persons in Virginia who
were able to give, and then in England where he quickly gained
the active interest of Queen Mary and King William. He secured
his charter for the College in 1693 and by 1695 the erection of
college buildings was well under way. He served as president of
the college until his death in 1743. He steered it through its
early difficulties; he fought for it against Governor and Council
when necessary; and he brought it to its full status as a College
with six professors and more than a hundred students in 1729. He
lived long enough to welcome Reverend George Whitefield, the
first great leader of the evangelical movement, when he came to
Williamsburg in 1740, and had the happiness to learn that his
College had won the admiring approval of his visitor. Whitefield
wrote in his diary an account of what he saw, and ended, "I rejoiced
in seeing such a place in America."</p>

<p>Commissary Blair fought steadily and successfully for the
rights and privileges of the clergy, and secured real increase in
clerical salaries. He fought also for the right of the vestries to
elect the rectors of their own parishes, even as he strove when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
need was, to secure the removal of the occasional unworthy
clergyman.</p>

<p>The organization of the College of William and Mary in 1693
was indeed the culmination of the plan of the London Company
to establish a University in Virginia. The first effort went up in
smoke in 1622. There was another effort in the days of Sir
William Berkeley after the Restoration, but the time was not
then ripe. But the opportunity came again. Already there were
several endowed schools in Virginia: The Syms School in
Hampton, the Eaton School, also in that parish, the Peasley
School in Gloucester County, and others. Many parish clergymen
also became noted for the excellency of their schools. So
the College which began in 1693 came to head a group of
schools which had already spread through the colony.</p>

<p>From its beginning it held to the ideal of having a School of
Divinity to train men for the ministry of the Church of England,
as well as a school of philosophy or liberal arts as we now describe
it, to train men for secular life and leadership in the colonial life.
When the College reached its maturity it had a School of Divinity
with two professors, and a School of Philosophy with two, in
addition to masters in other departments. It had also a foundation
which could support eight men studying for the ministry. From
that time until the Revolution a steady stream of candidates went
from the College to the Bishop of London for ordination. But
that is part of the story of the next century. The beginning came
in 1693.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_SEVEN" id="CHAPTER_SEVEN"></a>CHAPTER SEVEN<br /><br />

The Last Decade</h2>


<p>The decade 1690-1700 was an era of steady growth in the
religious and cultural life of Virginia. New counties were created
as population spread further and further up the great rivers; and
parishes increased in numbers as the population grew. The first
official list of "The parishes and the clergymen in them" which
has survived the wreckage of time was the list of 1680, and the
next is the list of 1702. These lists show that in 1680 there were
forty-eight parishes and thirty-six clergymen incumbents. In the
list of 1702 there were fifty parishes and forty clergymen.</p>

<p>The one most notable event in the religious life of both England
and Virginia was enactment by Parliament in 1689 of the
Edict of Toleration. That act in the first year of the reign of
King William and Queen Mary was the first incident in the
movement of the English people through their legislature toward
freedom of religion. The Act did not repeal the severe laws
against dissent adopted in the reign of King Charles, II, but it
did remove the penalties. It took the first step along a new roadway
into human freedom; and the English-speaking world on
both sides of the Atlantic hailed it as such.</p>

<p>As it was a law of England, the act did not come into effect
in Virginia until it was included within the code of laws of the
colony. That was not done until 1699, although the Council of
State had approved the act in principle early in that decade. By
that time enforcement of law requiring attendance at church
every Sunday had been relaxed for it was impossible of enforcement
under the conditions of Virginian life. The law was
not repealed until late in the eighteenth century and under it
every person wherever possible was required to accept attendance
at church as the duty of every citizen. In revisal of the Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
law in 1699 it was provided that every person must attend worship
in the parish church at least once every two months. The
General Assembly at the same time enacted a new proviso whereby
dissenters from the Established Church of Virginia, who
could qualify if in England as belonging to denominations or
groups permitted under the Toleration Act, were free in Virginia
from any penalty for non-attendance at the parish Church if
they attended their own places of dissenting worship at least once
in the two months period.</p>

<p>In 1699 there were three denominations of dissent in Virginia;
the Presbyterians, the Baptists and the Quakers. The many
thousands of immigrants from Scotland who had belonged to the
Established (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland found little to
object to in the worship of the Established Church of Virginia,
and entered into it without difficulty or objection.</p>

<p>But the Presbyterians from England, as dissenters from the
Established Church of that country, and the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians
who began their immigration to Virginia after the Restoration,
brought with them the determination to organize in America
as a Presbyterian denomination. They were especially strong in
the counties of Princess Anne and Norfolk; and the first Presbyterian
congregation in Virginia was organized in 1692 in that
area. It is also of interest to note that the Reverend Francis
Makemie, who organized the first presbytery in Philadelphia
about 1705 and later the first Synod of the Presbyterian Church
in America, lived for many years in Accomac County, Virginia.</p>

<p>There was a Baptist minister in the village of Yorktown during
the decade 1690-1700 but little is known of his work, nor is it
known whether there were then one or more organized Baptist
congregations.</p>

<p>The Quakers were the most widely scattered and in numbers
probably the strongest of the three groups. They were especially
numerous in Henrico County and the eastern section of Hanover
County and on the Nansemond river. The Church Attendance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Act of 1699 and the Toleration Act of the English Parliament
applied to them as to other dissenters, but they were still under
suspicion as to their loyalty and also because they continued their
early custom of open and violent attacks on the religion and
worship of the orthodox Churches. They gave bitter offense by
their public announcements in time of war between England
and France or between England and Spain that they would give
aid and furnish such supplies as might be needed to any enemy
fleet which should come with hostile intent into the Virginian
waters.</p>

<p>While the laws which punished interruption of religious services
were still necessary and were enforced, the adoption of the
proviso in the Virginian Act of 1699 was a real step forward on
the way to the ultimate goal of entire freedom of worship. It
made the worship of the dissenters as truly legal as that of the
Established Church, and it removed from the dissenters the requirement
that they attend the worship of the Anglican Church.</p>

<p>Thomas Story, the noted English Quaker, who wrote and
published a journal of his life and work as a Quaker preacher,
gives an interesting account of his two prolonged visits to Virginia
in 1698/99 and in 1705. In his daily journal for 1705 he
comments at every stopping-place, with manifest pleasure, upon
the welcome given him and his friends and the freedom of public
preaching accorded him wherever he went. He was welcomed
and entertained over and again at Anglican homes and he records
occasionally the fact that a county sheriff or constable or justice
of the county court was present at his preaching. He does not
record any instance in which anyone in civil authority in the
colony protested against his preaching or attempted to stop him;
and the high point of his visit came when the Governor of Virginia,
learning of his approach, invited him and his friends to
the Governor's mansion, entertained them and gave them fruit
to carry with them on their journey toward Philadelphia.</p>

<p>So Virginia came to the end of its first century, having fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
through the various adverse conditions which its people found
along the way. The colony had come into an era of opportunity
and growth with a well established government, a seaborne trade
which brought prosperity, and a concept of religion which made
room for all forms of the Christian faith that would remain at
peace with each other, and as citizens be loyal to their government.
As the people approached their first centennial anniversary
celebration in 1707 they looked forward with a confidence born
of past experience to the new century upon which they were
to enter.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the Journal of the Life of Thomas Story,
during his visit to Virginia in 1698 are indicative of the attitude of the
people of Virginia toward religious toleration:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>8th Day of the 12th Month, we landed in Mockjack Bay&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Next Fourth Day being the 1st day of the 1st month (i.e. January,
1698/99) we went again by water to a monthly meeting at Chuckatuck,
where came our friend Elizabeth Webb from Gloucestershire in England,
who had been through all the English colonies on the Continent
of America and was now about to depart for England. The meeting was
large and the Sheriff of the County, a Colonel, and some of others of note
in that county were there, and very sober and attentive.</p>

<p>On the 22nd we had a pretty large meeting at Southern Branch, at
the house of Robert Burgess. He was not a Friend by profession, but a
Justice of the Peace, and of good account in these parts. There had never
been a meeting there before; yet the people were generally solid and
several of them tendered; and after the meeting the Justice and his wife
were very respectful, and treated us to beer and wine, and would gladly
have had us to have eaten with them and lodged in their house that
night, but being otherwise engaged in the course of the service.</p>

<p>The next day [several days later] we had a meeting at Romancock,
which was large and open. Many persons of note from those parts were
there, as Major Palmer, Captain Clayborn, Doctor Walker, and others,
all very attentive.</p></div>

<p>It will be noted that the above list reports fifty-one parishes, or after
deducting three which appear as partly in two counties, a total of forty-eight
parishes. These covered the whole territory in which English settlers
lived. The incumbent clergymen total thirty-five but some five or six of
the parishes for which no incumbent was named were very small in
extent or population, and looked to the minister of an adjoining parish
for services and sacraments. Probably this list includes five or six parishes
which were vacant. Because of the great length of time required to secure
clergymen from England this fact is evidence of the growing strength
and organization of the Church under the influence of the Commissary.</p>

<p>Most of the clergymen who came to Virginia were graduates of the
English and Scottish universities, and brought an element and influence
of education and culture to the growing life of the Colony. Dr. Philip
Alexander Bruce, in his notable <i>Institutional History of Virginia in the
Seventeenth Century</i>, makes the following statement:</p>

<p>If we consider as a body the ministers who performed the various duties
of their calling in Virginia during the Seventeenth Century, there is no
reason to think they fell below the standard of conscientiousness governing
the conduct of the English clergyman in the same age. The early
history of the New World was adorned by no nobler group of divines
than the group which gives so much distinction from the point of view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of character and achievement to the years in which the foundation of
the colony at Jamestown was being permanently laid.</p>

<p>From the middle of the century to the end as from the beginning to
the middle, a large proportion of the clergymen were not only graduates
of English universities, but also men of more or less distinguished social
connections in England. Outside the great towns in England, or the
wealthiest and most populous of the English rural parishes, there was
in the course of the century, perhaps no single English living filled by
a succession of clergymen superior to this body of men, (i.e., incumbents
at Jamestown) in combined learning, talents, piety, and devotion to duty.
And yet there is no reason to think that the ability, zeal and fidelity of
these ministers who occupied the pulpit at Jamestown were overshadowing
as compared with the same qualities in the clergymen who, one after
another, occupied any of the more important benefices in York, Surry,
Elizabeth City, or Gloucester Counties, or the counties situated in the
Northern Neck, or Eastern Shore.... All the surviving records of the
seventeenth century go to show that, whatever during that long period
may have been the infirmities or unworthy acts of individual clergymen,
the great body of those officiating in Virginia were men who performed
all the duties of their sacred calling in a manner entitling them to the
respect, reverence and gratitude of their parishioners.</p>

<p>Very little is known of the activities of the clergy outside of their
professional duties beyond the fact that a great many of them conducted
schools at their homes; and these "parsons schools" became a widespread
influence for good upon the youth of their day. In the generations before
the founding of the College these schools became the great agency
throughout the colony for the education of the sons of the gentry, and
of the occasional youth of a lesser privileged family who was taken free
by the parson, or supported by a school endowment given by some
charitable person. In the later days there were many such parish funds.
We read of George Washington, in the following generation attending
the school conducted by Parson Marye in Fredericksburg, and of his
future wife, Martha Dandridge attending another.</p>

<p>It is a notable fact that throughout the whole seventeenth century the
ideal shown by the General Assembly was to provide for the clergy an
adequate salary for the comfortable home of an educated man. In 1695
when the question of increase in clerical salaries was raised, the House
of Burgesses made a report to Governor Andros upon the purchasing
value of salaries paid in tobacco, and stated, "They have duly weighed
the present provision made for the ministers of this country in their
respective parishes together with their other considerable perquisites by
marriages, burials, etc., and glebes,&mdash;&mdash;that most if not all the ministers
of this country are in as good a condition in point of livelihood
as a gentleman that is well seated and hath twelve or fourteen servants."
They had previously stated that the tobacco salary of the parson would
in normal years in the past yield eighty pounds sterling when sold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>In contrast with this salary of the clergymen in Virginia attention
may be called to the statement made in England in 1714, that there
were in England at that time "5,082 livings under eighty pounds in
annual value, of which more than 3,000 were under forty pounds, and
471 under ten pounds. This report was made to show the importance of
the fund established by Queen Anne, called Queen Anne's Bounty, for
increasing the endowment of these weak parishes."</p>
